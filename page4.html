		<h1><b>Gary Duffy</b></h1>
		<p> Gary, who was born in New Zealand and planned to become a sheep farmer, came to Canada when he was 25 years old and fell in love with the country. 
		His job path changed four months later to tourism, with a focus on selling Canada and Alaska. Gary had traveled across Canada more than 80 times by the time he relocated to Canada in April 2000. 
		He continues to travel around Canada and Alaska in pursuit of new and exciting experiences, and his favorite vacation spot is Sonora Resort, which offers wildlife viewing as well as wonderful food and wine.</p>

	<div class="col-md-4">
		<h3><b>Favourite Time Of The Year To Travel</b></h3>
		<q>My favorite months to travel the Rockies is either May or June, when an abundance of wildlife can be seen feeding near the highways as they wait for the snow to melt on the mountains. 
		Note that from May to mid-June the lakes in the Rockies will still be frozen, so if you want to see the iconic deep blue color I recommend visiting in September.</q>

		<h1><b>Clayton Molstad</b></h1>
		<p>Clayton grew up in a small town in Northwestern Ontario – the kind of place that gets so much snow in the winter it becomes wise (and sometimes necessary) to take a snowmobile to school. 
		was one of the first Canadian students to do an exchange in the Soviet Union, an experience that set him on a path to explore the world. 
		Having cut his teeth in the telecommunications industry, Clayton was lured into the company on the anticipated challenge of building a business with Gary.</p>

		Knight Inlet Lodge and polar bear viewing up north in Churchill, Manitoba. Ok… I have a thing for bears!</q>

		<h3><b>Best Travel Moment In Canada</b></h3>
		<q>I will never forget my first journey to the Rockies! Everything I had read and heard about was true. I traveled by bus to Jasper National Park and enjoyed a week full of amazing scenery, wildlife, skiing, 
		hiking and dining at cozy restaurants. I arrived on the most pristine day to Lake Louise, and it was a surreal 'pinch-me' moment! 
		I could not get enough of the mountains, fresh air and wildlife and I can't wait to do it all over again, next time by rail.</q>

		<h3><b>Favourite Place In Canada</b></h3>
		<q>Not only is Canada's West Coast my favorite part of the country, but it's an excellent place to surround yourself with wildlife and outdoor activities. 
		Full of fantastic history and culture, there's a lot to learn about the region's Indigenous peoples, and if you're looking for a taste of local cuisine, West Coast cuisine will not let you down!</q>

		<h3><b>One Thing In Canada That Should Be Experienced Atleast Once</b></h3>
		<q>Visiting Whistler is an absolute must, regardless of the season. While it's most famous for its winter activities, there are still lots of things to do both in the summer and shoulder seasons.

		<h3><b>One Thing In Canada That Should Be Experienced Atleast Once</b></h3>
		<q>Paddle boarding or kayaking at a lake in Vancouver or even in False Cleek is highly recommended. 
		It's amazing how you can enjoy beautiful urban and mountain views at the same time from the water. 
		I was particularly lucky as I had a chance to see a beaver dam and the family of beavers just two feet in front of me! 
		It’s very relaxing and the perfect way to end my day after work or on the weekend.</q>

		The beaches, hikes and water are all breathtaking, and you can spend hours at the beach surfing and not even notice the time of day. Its a place to escape which is why I love it so much.</q>
